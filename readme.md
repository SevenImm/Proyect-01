# Main:
This branch should only be used for approved code integration. This branch will be displayed as a page

## Dev:
All finished feature branches should go thru this branch. (Think of it as a beta release).

## Feature/homepage:
For this branch, I want to display a homepage that greets our users and present the application with instructions or a description.
