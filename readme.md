# GitHub Weather

## Project Description:
GitHub Weather is a fun and unique project that combines your GitHub contributions with real-time weather data to provide you with a visual representation of your coding activity and how it correlates with local weather conditions. 
By inputting your GitHub username and the city you live in, you can see a summary of your contributions mapped alongside weather patterns. This project adds a playful twist to visualizing your coding journey and weather-related insights.


## Features:
GitHub Integration: Easily connect your GitHub profile to access your contribution data. <br>
Weather Data: Fetches real-time weather information based on your provided city. <br>
Visualization: Presents your contributions alongside weather data on a 5 day forecast max. <br>

## Important Info:
Due to GitHub's API, we couldn't pull contributions for a user unless they had made a contribution in the last couple of months. <br>
If your username doesn't pull up anything, that is the reason and please try a different username.  <br>
This will be a focus of further development <br>
